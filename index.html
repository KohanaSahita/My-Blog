                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">i had visited in dec 2018</h5>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">One of the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling. It is situated in peaceful and beautiful landscape just 15 minutes walk from Ghoom Railway Station. We can see religious God and Goddess paintings believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with clean heart. From the compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature lovers.</p>

                <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

        <ul class="list-group">

            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 Harry_li">
                <h4>Ravenclaw Has Very Few Memorable Characters</h4>
                <img src="e1.jpeg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In the end, Luna Lovegood was the one who had the biggest impact on the story of all Ravenclaw students. There was also Cho Chang but the books (or Harry, really) didn't always portray her in the most positive light. Even though Ravenclaw is full of talented people, they never got as much space as people from other houses, most notably Gryffindor and Slytherin.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 Harry_li">
                <h4>Most hated charecters in Harry Potter ( Cho Chang )</h4>
                <img src="e3.jpeg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">This hate is a bit undeserved as, in the books, Cho did not do anything wrong. She was simply frustrated by Harry's inability to pick up on any of the signals that she sent his way and was a bit competitive with the other girls in his life as she worried that he was far more into them than he was into her.

However, in the films, Cho deserves a little bit of guff from the fandom as she did sell Dumbledore's Army out to Dolores Umbridge and her investigation squad. Not cool.</p>
